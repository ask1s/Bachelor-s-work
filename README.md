# My Bachelor's work from TUKE (Technical University of Kosice)
##Comparison of throughput and response of network communication protocols (using C++)

The main language is Slovak, but it's not hard to just translate the pdf into English if that's what you're interested in.  
**Folders:**
1. Diagrams - Folder in which all diagrams of the created programs and functions are stored;
2. DIM - Folder with server's and client's programs to measure throughput and response using DIM protocol and RPC message mechanism;
3. Graffs - Folder with a visual representation of the tests carried out;
4. Screens - Folder with photographs that were used in the bachelor's work;
5. TCP - Folder with server's and client's programs to measure throughput and response using TCP/IP;
6. UDP - Folder with server's and client's programs to measure throughput and response using UDP/IP.
